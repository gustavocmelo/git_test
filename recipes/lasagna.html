    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
    <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>Chop onion</ol>
    <ol>Crush garlic</ol>
    <ol>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</ol>
    <ol>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned.</ol>
    <ol>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.</ol>
    <ol>Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley.</ol>
    <ol>Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</ol>
    <ol>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</ol>
    <ol>Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</ol>
    <ol>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</ol>
    <ol>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</ol>
    <ol>Spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</ol>
    <ol>Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.</ol>
    <ol>Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture.</ol>
    <ol>Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices.</ol>
    <ol>Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</ol>
    <ol>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</ol>
    <ol>Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</ol>
    <ol>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</ol>
